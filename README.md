I used Tilt Neon, designed by Andy Clymer. its a set of three tilt fonts. but i personally like tilt neon as its inspired by neon tube signs that are found in front of stores. 

The tilt collection includes, Tilt Neon, Tilt Prism, and Tilt Warp. The designs were released in 2020. 
## What was this project and how did I deliver it?
This project is making a website for a variable font, having its history, showing the variables (vertical rotation, horizontal rotation), a full charcter set, and a button to send people to the download location. I also used a Neon color palete to emphasize the Tilt NEON
